            <p>I'm a full stack developer with an insatiable desire to learn and create.
            Whether it's food, music, or tech, I always take the same approach- 
            start with the basics. I make sure that all the needs are met, then
            I add my signature with a high quality flourish that makes my creations
            stand out. I'm always thinking about ways to improve and expand on my work,
            and I love to take on a new challenge.<br /><br />
            Grab a cup of coffee, take a look around. If you have any questions or
            would like to get to know me better, make sure to reach out <a href='#contact'>here.</a></p>
