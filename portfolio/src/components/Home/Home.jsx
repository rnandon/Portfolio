        <p>Hi, I'm Ryan! I'm glad you're here.

        I'm a full stack developer with an insatiable desire to learn and create. Whether it's food, music, or tech, I always take the same approach- start with the basics. I make sure that all the needs are met, then I add my signature with a high quality flourish that makes my creations stand out. I'm always thinking about ways to improve and expand on my work, and I love to take on a new challenge.
        
        Grab a cup of coffee, take a look around. If you have any questions or would like to get to know me better, make sure to reach out here.
        </p>
